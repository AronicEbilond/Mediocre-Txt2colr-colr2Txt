# Mediocre-Txt2colr-colr2Txt
A basic text to color, color to text converter. Made it with AI. Wish I could make it myself, but I don't know how to program nor where to start.

The pixels themselves will be organised like they are in the image, but in text, like character-art, you know?
Same goes for the modifier-document for more complex colors & mixed colors.

Basic Overview of what characters mean what;
ROYGBIV PLUS n, w & g letters for their corresponding colors(n is for noire which is black in english by the way, so that's why its not the same);
Red,
Orange,
Yellow,
Green,
Blue,
Indigo,
Violet,
Black,
White,
Gray,

And another layer of code in a seperate text file, for different shades of these colors and for these colors too
with this layer distinguished as modifying the pixels it does, via the positioning in the text file, indicated via comas
so say, 101, would be considered at column 1 and row 1, and the one following it, will be interpreted as being at column 2 row one, with it working via deeming the position based on what it'd look like if there were only comas, with the numbers used for telling the program what the color-modifier will be, and the coma, being used, after interpreting what the positioning of the numbers in the document would look like, with only comas in the document, because that is valueble position data...

As for other formats, my idea would be to convert them directly kinda? Idk though, makes more sense to just, convert it to an image and then to another format?
And there'll be 255 shades? Well, maybe. So as to be compatible with other color formats I suppose?


And just for an example, here's what an image of a simplified video clip icon(like you'd see in an operating system's representation of video-files with the "chain-link" border-looking thing), with say, 5 by 10 pixels would look like
